Tomo is a GUI toolkit written in pure Go, designed to be minimalist, frugal, and
extendable. It is currently in early development, so some features may not work
as expected.

You can find out more about how to use it by visiting the examples directory,
or pull up its documentation by running `godoc` within the repository.
